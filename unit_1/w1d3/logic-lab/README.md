## Introduction

### What we are doing

In this lab, we will practice Computational Thinking by breaking down everyday activities into specific steps.

> ***Note:*** _This Lab is designed to be done independently._


### Why we are doing it

Computational Thinking (CT) is a problem solving process that includes a number of characteristics and dispositions. CT is essential to the development of computer applications, but it can also be used to support problem solving across all disciplines, including the humanities, math, and science. Students who learn CT across the curriculum can begin to see a relationship between academic subjects, as well as between life inside and outside of the classroom.

Computational Thinking is what allows you to "Think in Code".

## Exercise

In these exercises, we will be decomposing activities into a simple language called `pseudo-english`.

For each exercise, explain in three different level of details, **Low**, **Medium**, **High**.

**For example**

This is how to describe **"How to drive a car out of a garage"** in a series of steps:

**High Level**
```
#1 > Drive the car out of the garage
```

**Medium Level**
```
#1 > Find my car
#2 > Get in the car
#3 > Turn the car on
#4 > Drive the car away
```

**Low Level**
```
#1 > For every car in the garage
    #2 > If car is my car, go to #4
#3 > Can't find my car. Panic!ðŸ˜±
#4 > Walk to the car
#5 > If the car is unlocked, go to #7
#6 > Unlock the car
#7 > Open the Door
#8 > Sit in the driver's seat
#9 > Close the Door
#10 > If Tesla, smile, go to #13
#11 > Put the key in the ignition
#12 > Turn the key
#13 > Buckle up
#14 > If today is Friday, Honk two times.
(etc)
...
```

> ***Note:*** Use your judgement to determine how "Low" you want to go.
